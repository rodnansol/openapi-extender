== Motivation

Writing proper OpenAPI documentations are time-consuming, if you really
want to make sure your clients are understanding the API itself, massive
amount of summaries and examples should be provided, not mandatory, but
if you are on the other side of the API, you might be also happier if an
API documentation is verbose as possible.

== Goals

The goal of this project to make sure that your OpenAPI documentation is
having enough extra details, that you might not want to write by
yourself in the documentation, but you would like to use other, earlier
written resources to fulfil these requirements/needs/gaps in your
documentation.

Developers are writing unit and integration tests on their projects, and
a good test could be providing the different input and output values for
a component. API developers are writing tons of integration tests for
the different use cases and it happens sometimes that they are not
giving out these tests, because of course security and privacy rules,
but some output of these tests could be used to extend the already
existing API.

== Alternatives

* https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-restdocs[Springâ€™s REST Docs]
does something similar, but it is not heavily involved in the OpenAPI
initiative.
* https://github.com/ePages-de/restdocs-api-spec[Spring REST Docs API
specification Integration] kinda the wanted features, but it is totally
test driven.

== Implementation

The project is split up into multiple modules to make sure the end users
are not depending on some unnecessary dependencies:

* openapi-extender - Core part, that does the ``heavy-lifting'' that
works with the OpenAPI model classes
* openapi-extender-resource-generator - Resource generator module that
is generating the resource files based on different content
* openapi-extender-spring-test - Spring Test extension
* openapi-extender-springdoc - SpringDoc extension
